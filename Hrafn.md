# The Tale of Hrafn Gudrunsson

there was a man named Thorgrim, who lived at Stad in Hrutafjord.
he was rich in sheep, and a poor manager.
his wife was named Thorgerdur, their sons: kalf and Grim.
they were capable enough, pushy and untrustworthy, just like their father.

there was a man named Sighvatur, who lived in melar in Hrutafjord. 
His wife was sharp-minded Gudrun, who was strong of will.
their son was Hrafn, young, handsome and great of stature.

Sighvatur spent more than he made.
He owned good land, but his flock was being used up.
one summer he told his wife that their land must be sold to pay debts and buy livestock.

She answers. "there is another way. Sell my gold ring, rather than the land",
